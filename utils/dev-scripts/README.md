When making a new feature, run these 2 commands

1- before making any changes, run **bash new-branch.sh <branch-name>**

2- after making any changes you want to save, run **bash commit-and-push.sh "commit message"**


runnning this will put all changes in a big commit and push to gitlab. this is not ideal but will do for now as your learning still, and will probably make minimal changes (meaning no need for complex commits and version control)
